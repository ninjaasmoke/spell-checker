1. Define the Project Structure:
        
    Create a folder structure for the project.
Consider having separate folders for headers (include), source files (src), and possibly a folder for test files (test).

1. Write a Levenshtein Distance Function:

    Implement a recursive Levenshtein distance function to calculate the edit distance between two words. This function will be part of spell-checking algorithm.

3. Create the Spell Checker Interface (Strategy):

    Define a SpellCheckStrategy interface or abstract class with a method like isSpelledCorrectly.
    The interface will be the foundation for different spell-checking strategies, such as Levenshtein distance-based checking.

4. Implement the Levenshtein Spell Checker:

    Create a class that implements the SpellCheckStrategy interface and uses the Levenshtein distance function to check spelling.

5. File I/O Functions:

    Implement functions for reading from the "sample.txt" file and writing to the "fixed.txt" file.
    Handle errors and edge cases gracefully.

6. Main Application:

    Write the main application that ties everything together.
    Instantiate the Levenshtein spell checker and use it to check and correct spellings in the input file.

7. Testing:

    Test spell checker with different inputs, including cases with intentional errors.
    Ensure that the corrected words are written to the "fixed.txt" file.

8. Documentation:
    Add comments to code for better understanding.
